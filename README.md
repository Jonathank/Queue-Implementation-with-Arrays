# Queue-Implementation-with-Arrays

In this section, we will consider how to use an array to efficiently support the FIFO semantics of the Queue ADT.
Let’s assume that as elements are inserted into a queue, we store them in an rray such that the first element is at index 0, the second element at index 1, and so on.
Using an array to store elements of a queue, such that the first element inserted, “A”, is at cell 0, the second element inserted, “B”, at cell 1, and so on.
